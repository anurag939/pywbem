About this project
------------------

Pywbem is a WBEM client, written in pure Python. It runs on Python 2 and
Python 3.

A WBEM client allows issuing operations to a WBEM server, using the CIM
operations over HTTP (CIM-XML) protocol defined in the DMTF standards DSP0200
and DSP0201. The CIM/WBEM infrastructure is used for a wide variety of systems
management tasks supported by systems running WBEM servers. See
[WBEM Standards](http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wbem) for more information about
WBEM.
