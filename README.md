PyWBEM Client
-------------

The PyWBEM Client project provides a WBEM client library and some related
utilities, written in pure Python.

A WBEM client allows issuing operations to a WBEM server, using the CIM
operations over HTTP (CIM-XML) protocol defined in the DMTF standards
DSP0200 and DSP0201. See http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wbem for information
about WBEM. This is used for all kinds of systems management tasks that are
supported by the system running the WBEM server.

Usage
-----

For information on how to use the PyWBEM Client for your own development
projects, or how to contribute to it, go to the
[PyWBEM Client page](http://pywbem.github.io/pywbem/)
