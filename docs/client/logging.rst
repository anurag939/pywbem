WBEM operation logging
----------------------

.. automodule:: pywbem._logging
   :members:

.. # Note: Using the :members: option on automodule includes its data
.. # members automatically, but also recursively includes its class
.. # PywbemLoggers, showing it with the submodule namespace:
.. # pywbem._logging.PywbemLoggers. It seems the only way to not show the
.. # submodule namespace would be to have an autodata directive for each of
.. # the 6 (or so) public data items in the module, and a separate autoclass
.. # directive.
