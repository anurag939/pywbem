    "For some CIM classes, it makes no sense to support deletion of their CIM instances. For some others, deletion of its CIM instances and consequently deletion of the represented managed resources is defined. Such a deletion semantics is typically not defined in the class definitions in the CIM Schema, but in their usage definitions in WBEM Management Profiles (see DMTF standard DSP1001). Often, management profiles that define a semantics for the deletion of managed resources, leave that optional for an implementation to support. The implementation for a CIM class in the WBEM server (aka CIM provider) thus may or may not support deletion of its instances and the represented managed resources.\n",
