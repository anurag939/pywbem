Provide an interactive shell for issuing operations against a WBEM server.

Positional arguments:
  server                Host name or url of the WBEM server in this format:
                            [{scheme}://]{host}[:{port}]
                        -scheme: Defines the url scheme;
                            - "https" for ssl protocol
                            - "http"" for non-ssl protocol.

                               identifier extensions(RFC 6874)
                               supporting "-" or %25 for the delimiter.
                        -port: Defines the WBEM server port to be us ed
                         Defaults::
                             - http  - 5988
                             - https - 5989

Server related options:
  Specify the WBEM server namespace and timeout

  -n namespace, --namespace namespace
                        Default namespace in the WBEM server for operation
                        requests when namespace option not supplied with
                        operation request.
                        Default: root/cimv2
  -t timeout, --timeout timeout
                        Timeout in the WBEM server in seconds for operation to
                        complete.
                        Default: No timeout

Connection security related options:
  Specify user name and password or certificates and keys

  -u user, --user user  User name for authenticating with the WBEM server.
                        Default: No user name.
  -p password, --password password
                        Password for authenticating with the WBEM server.
                        Default: Will be prompted for, if user name
                        specified.
  -nvc, --no-verify-cert
                        Client will not verify WBEM returned by the WBEM
                        server against certificates in cacerts argument or
                        system defined certs. This bypasses the client-side
                        verification of the server identity, but allows
                        encrypted communication with a server for which the
                        client does not have certificates.
  --cacerts cacerts     File or directory containing certificates that will be
                        matched against a certificate received from the WBEM
                        server.
                        The --no-verify-cert option must be set to bypass
                        client verification of the WBEM server certificaties.
                        The system directories searched for certificates are:
                        Default: Search for matching certificates in the
                        following system directories:
                        /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/openssl/ca-bundle.trust.crt
                        /etc/ssl/certs
                        /etc/ssl/certificates
  --certfile certfile   Client certificate file for authenticating with the
                        WBEM server. If option specified the client attempts
                        to execute mutual authentication.
                        Default: Simple authentication.
  --keyfile keyfile     Client private key file for authenticating with the
                        WBEM server. Not required if private key is part of the
                        certfile option. Not allowed if no certfile option.
                        Default: No client key file.
