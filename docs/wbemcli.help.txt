usage: wbemcli [options] server

Provide an interactive shell for issuing operations against a WBEM server.

Positional arguments:
  server                Host name or IP address of the WBEM server. Prefix
                        with "https://" for ssl connection or
                        "http://"(optional) for non-ssl connection:

Server related options:
  Specify the WBEM server connection type, port, and namespace

  --port port           (Deprecated) Port where the WBEM server listens.
                        Default: Standard WBEM defined ports( non-ssl=5988 or
                        ssl=5989). This option is deprecated in favor of
                        adding port to server as a suffix preceded by ":"
  -n namespace, --namespace namespace
                        Namespace in the WBEM server to work against.
                        Default: root/cimv2
  -t timeout, --timeout timeout
                        Timeout in the WBEM server in seconds for operation to
                        complete.
                        Default: No timeout(None)
  --no-ssl              (Deprecated)Don't use SSL for the connection. This
                        option is deprecated in favor of using http or https
                        on server argument.

Connection security related options:
  Specify user name and password or certificates and keys

  -u user, --user user  Username for authenticating with the WBEM server.
                        Default: No username.
  -p password, --password password
                        Password for authenticating with the WBEM server.
                        Default: Will be prompted for, if username was
                        specified.
  -no, --no_verification
                        Do not verify wbem server returned certificate against
                        certs in ca_certs or system defined certs.
  --ca_certs CaCerts    File or directory containing certificates that will be
                        matched against a certificate received from the WBEM
                        server. Default: None. However, if None, pywbem will
                        search for possible certificates in default system
                        directories. Therefore, --no-verification must be
                        supplied to bypass client verification of server sent
                        certificaties.
  --certfile certfile   Client certificate file for authenticating with the
                        WBEM server.
                        Default: None. 
  --keyfile keyfile     Client private key file for authenticating with the
                        WBEM server.
                        Default: None. 

General options:
  -v, --verbose         Print more messages while processing
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
