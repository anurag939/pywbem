Tutorial
========

This is a short tutorial about using PyWBEM. It is intended to be enough to get
people up and going who already know a bit about WBEM and CIM.

Python code examples this tutorial are shown using
`Jupyter Notebooks <jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/>`_
(formerly known as IPython Notebooks), using the online
`Jupyter Notebook Viewer <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/>`_.
This allows viewing them without having Jupyter installed locally.

In order to run or modify the examples, Jupyter Notebook must be installed,
and a running WBEM server should be available.

The following table lists the tutorial sections and download links for the
notebook files.
